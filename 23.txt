Tesla Stock Joins the S&P 500: A Game Changer
The benchmark’s latest rebalance is as unconventional as its new component

The electric car maker is the biggest company ever to join the S&P 500, the most widely tracked broad stock-market benchmark. Shares of Tesla have surged 70% since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced its planned addition in November, boosting the company’s market value to more than $650 billion.

That’s more than three times the value of Berkshire Hathaway, the second-biggest addition to the index by market value, when it was added to the S&P 500 in 2010. Tesla is currently the sixth-largest publicly listed firm in the U.S. by that measure.

Thanks to this year’s 731% rally, Tesla’s market value trails only Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook.

BEFORE THE RALLY

In May 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic accelerated the investor rush into purported technology winners, more than 170 S&P 500 stocks ranked ahead of Tesla in market value.

SECTOR DOMINANCE

Tesla’s rise has been bolstered by a stimulus-fueled surge in the value of technology stocks and a streak of quarterly profits. It enters the index as the second-biggest stock in the S&P 500’s consumer discretionary group, behind Amazon.com.

AUTO IMBALANCE

The electric-vehicle manufacturer is now about seven times the combined value of Ford and General Motors, despite having a fraction of the other companies’ deliveries.

NEW ENERGY

Tesla is nearly as big as the entire S&P 500 energy sector, which now accounts for roughly 2% of the broad index’s weighting, down from 13% in 2011.

CLASS OF 2020

The newest S&P 500 component dwarfs the other 15 that were added to the index this year.

Adding a company of Tesla’s size to the broad stock-market gauge means funds that track the index need to buy lots of its stock and sell some others.

S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would consider adding the company in two separate tranches to spread out that trading, but ultimately decided to add it all at once.

Individual and institutional investors alike have flocked to Tesla’s shares this year, making it one of the most popular momentum stocks. Another driving force behind its rise has been its shift to consistent profits, which began in the third quarter of 2019.

A key barrier to Tesla’s inclusion in the S&P 500 has been the requirement that companies must report an accumulated profit over four consecutive quarters.

Tesla checked that box after reporting a profit in the second quarter this year. But it wasn’t added to the index until after extending its streak to five-straight with a profit in the third quarter.

Still, many short-sellers cast doubt over Tesla’s potential and say that its results don't match its valuation. They say that competitors will catch up to Tesla and question its earnings, pointing to how its sale of regulatory credits have boosted profits. Tesla last quarter reported $331 million in net income, including nearly $400 million from sales of regulatory credits.

Short sellers have been hit hard by the company’s rise and many have closed out losing bets, bringing short interest to a recent low, according to IHS Markit Data. Even so, the carmaker remains the most-shorted stock in the world, with $32 billion in bearish bets outstanding, according to S3 Partners LLC.
