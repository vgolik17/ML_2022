Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA 5.78%▲ said Friday in a corporate blog post that it will install its first battery swap facility in California and invite some owners of the Model S electric sedan to participate at a “cost slightly less than a full tank of gasoline for a premium sedan.”

The Silicon Valley-based car company said the battery-swap program, currently a pilot project, will be based in Harris Ranch, Calif. The building where swaps take place will be located near Tesla supercharger stations, at which Model S owners can charge their cars for free.

Instead of charging cars, which powers at a rate of 400 miles of battery life per hour, swapping a battery can take approximately three minutes. Tesla said it hopes to cut the time it takes to remove a battery pack and put in a new one to under one minute in the future.

“Tesla will evaluate relative demand from customers for paid pack swap versus free charging to assess whether it merits the engineering resources and investment necessary,” the company said.
